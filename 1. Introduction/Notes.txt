1. The link Element goes inside our <head> </head> element always.
Syntax: (link tab) (href ke andar address of the external css file.)

2. Color Attribute is responsible for changing the color of the texts only. Not the background color or anything else.
Most visible example will be button color will change the color of the text in the button not the background color of the button.

================================= Text Properties =======================================================
3. When we write h2 {
    color : teal;
}
-> It changes the color of ALL the H2s TEXTS not a particular one.

4. Background-color will, ofc change the color of the background.
-> Since the h1s and the h2s are the block elements they take up the entire space that is available to them.

5. System we use for referencing the different colors:
Can hover over the color box to change the color on the spot. vlick on hex or rgb to change the system.
--> Named Colors: blue green red teal cyan rebbecapurple ... 144 named colors present

--> RGB (red,green,blue) numbers. rgb(28,255,112)  [255 max value]

--> Hexadecimal : Includes(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F) highest being F (15). Includes 6 characters
#    ff    ff      00   
    red   green   blue
 can use shortners like: #cc55ee -> #c5e, #000000-> #000. Can use them when 2 are same values.

 6. text-align: It will align the text wrt the total space of that entity. For example block element will become centre allign wrt to the whole block.
 --> If we do width: 50% (overall width decrease to 50%) so ab it will become centre align wrt the remaining 50% of the block.

 7. font-weight: Thickness of the text. Indicated by different methods: 
 --> Key Values
font-weight: normal , bold , lighter , bolder

--> Numeric Values: 400 -> Normal, 700 -> Bold

8. text-decoration: underline, underline dotted , underline dotted red , green wavy underline , underline overline #FF3028 ... and so on.

====> Most useful Cases: 

-> When there are anchor tags present there comes an automatic underline. Thatlooks ugly so we should remove that underline by a{
    text-decoration: none
} which will remove the underline but still keep the blue color of the hyperlinks so that it is still differentiated from the normal texts.

-> Other usecase is while making a todo list, we use the text-decoration: line-through to strike through the tasks that have been done.

9. line-height: Controls the space BETWEEN the texts, sepeartion btw 2 lines of texts, vertical spacing: 
Nomenclatre: 
line-height: normal , 2.5 , 150% , 32px , 3em (a unit,discussed later) 

10. letter-spacing: Exactly simmilar to font-height but controls the spacing between the letters, horizontal spacing.
(does not have the ONLY numeric value as its value eg: 10 not available but 10px done!)

11. font-size: size of the fonts
--> font-size: 80px

12. Font Family: will change the font of the text: 
-> We can only use the fonts supported by our machines. For example if some font is not present in the machine then it falls back to the next font.
we can also specify a font family instead of some specific font from the fasmily and the machine will automatically choose one of the fonts from the family.
For eg: monospace is the family and monaco is the dont inside this family.
